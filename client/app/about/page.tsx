          <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
            <strong>Vaibhav Group</strong> has proudly cultivated and exported greenery for over 15 years.
            Beginning as a passionate nursery in India, we have now grown into a global exporter
            of plants, handmade papers, and sustainable decor. Our vision is rooted in
            eco-consciousness, trust, and artisan excellence.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
            From rare ornamental plants to beautiful handcrafted paper products, our offerings
            reflect a blend of nature and culture. Our handmade papers are cherished by artists and
            crafters across borders for their texture, sustainability, and elegance.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
            Today, Vaibhav Group serves customers around the world â€” from botanical suppliers to
            art studios and gifting partners. We continue to grow with our core values: authenticity,
            customer-first approach, and respect for the environment.
